# Quick Find

Quickly jump to the thing you are searching for in Atom

__DON'T USE THIS YET__ it's not done.

![A screenshot of your package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif)

## Why?

The find and replace package exists, works well, and is built in. However, for
some reason, they made the design choice to not actually find as you type.

`incremental-search` also exists, but doesn't work. It also does a bunch of stuff
I don't really care about.

Finally, I wanted to write something new in order to learn how to build stuff in
atom.

## How it works

I am modeling it after cmd-f in intelliJ, since I like it and it works well.
